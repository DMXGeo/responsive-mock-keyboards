            <p> According to a recent poll by Massdrop, most users selected the Brown switch (Cherry MX) to be their favorite. Brown switches are known to be the sweet spot between Blue (Tactile) and Red (Linear) switches, they still feature a bump when pressed similar to Blues but are not as loud, similar to Reds. Enthusiasts will argue that while Gateron switches may be a "clone" of Cherry MX, they feature a smoother keypress. All in all, no matter what brand of Brown switches you get, they still present that happy medium between the other two options! </p>
