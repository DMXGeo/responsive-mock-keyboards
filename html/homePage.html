            <p> According to a recent poll by Massdrop, most users selected the Brown switch (Cherry MX) to be their favorite. Brown switches are known to be the sweet spot between Blue (Tactile) and Red (Linear) switches, they still feature a bump when pressed similar to Blues but are not as loud, similar to Reds. Enthusiasts will argue that while Gateron switches may be a "clone" of Cherry MX, they feature a smoother keypress. All in all, no matter what brand of Brown switches you get, they still present that happy medium between the other two options! </p>

            <p> &emsp; Corsair has been known for their many gaming peripherals, especially their mechanical keyboards. The K70 being the most popular due to it's full keyboard layout, media controls, and optional RGB custom lighting. The K70 also comes in three options for Cherry MX switches - Red, Blue, or Brown. The K series features other kinds of keyboards as well, the K60 series sporting a tenkeyless(TKL) design, while the K90 series features more keys for in-game macros. The K70 continues to be the desired winner of gamers since it has all of the bells and whistles needed to step up their level. </p>

            <h2>Ducky Shine Series</h2>
            <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Z8N2m0C.png" id="Ducky">
            <p> &emsp; Ducky has  been known for their high build quality and standardized keyboard layout. Ducky offers more options for mechanical switches such as Green, White, and other uncommon switches with varying characteristics. Apart from the K70 and similar gamer themed keyboards, the Ducky's more enthusiastic design allows more keycap options to replace the stock ones that come with board (Many gaming mechanicals feature non-standard keycap rows, meaning less customizing options in term of keycaps). The Ducky Shine series also comes with tenkeyless (TKL) options along with limited LED colors or full on RGB. </p>

            <h1>Best Budget Keyboard</h1>
            <h2>EagleTec KG011</h2>
            <img src="http://oi65.tinypic.com/122notk.jpg" id="Eagle">
            <p>Of course, investing into a mechanical keyboard can be a costly investment at times, especially if you want customizable options for the future. When looking through Amazon, there are many options for cheaper mechanical keyboards, it can be quite overwhelming. However, the EageleTec has stood out with positive reviews with its friendly price point of $45. And for good reason too, it features a full layout with an aluminum backplate. The blue switches are from Outemo, another off-brand of Cherry MX's, but most people wouldn't notice the difference. It dons only blue LED lighting, and a bit unorthodox font on the keys. The EagleTec entry level price and sturdy build quality while still being a full sized mech makes it a desirable keyboard indeed. </p>
